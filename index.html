<p>
  Slavery is still apparent in the world today.
  The freedom we all deserve and hold high has been taken away from helpless individuals around our world and in our own country.
  There are 27 million slaves in the world today. These individuals are sold like objects, having their freedom stripped from them and their families.
  From women being forced into prostitution, children and adults forced to work amongst the grueling conditions of agriculture, and entire families forced into slavery to pay off generational debts, this illegal practice still scourges the contemporary world.
