<h3> What is Bonded Labor? </h3>

<h2>  Bonded labor is form of slavery in which they are held as a slave until they work off their debt.
 </h2>
 <br> </br>
<h3> How Does This Still Happen? </h3>
<h2> This is mostly happening because someone needs a service, such as crossing the country's border but can't afford it.
  The service provider understands that the person can afford it but still agrees.
  In exchange the person that is poor will work for the service provider until the debt is paid off.

<br> </br>
 <h3> Why Is It Important? </h3>
<h2> The definition of bonded labor doesn't make this situation sound so bad. But it is all how the "slave owners" play by the rules.
  While the slaves work, they pay off their debt slowly. But then the owner adds more debt on top of what they owe for the small amount of food they
  consume and for the small area they can sleep. So really it takes a really long time just to pay off a small amount of debt. It can even take generations to pay off.
 </h2>
<h2> Once in debt, it is nearly impossiable to pay off. For example when becoming trapped into a medical cycle. According to Beth Herzfeld
  ,"Trapped in this cycle, bonded labourers find it almost impossiable to pay off their debt... poor diets, lack of access of health services
  mean they will frequently  become ill... because of sickness and medical treatment only increase the level of debt". The poor conditions in the
  workplace lead to illness that lead to medical bills that lead to an increase in the level of debt.
