<h1><center>Forced Labor</center></h1>
<h2>Forced labor is any work or services which people are forced to do against their will under some sort of threat. Forced labour takes different forms, including debt bondage, trafficking and other forms of modern slavery. Women and girls are the most vulnerable victims that are forced into prostitution, migrants trapped in debt bondage, and sweatshop or farm workers kept there by clearly illegal tactics and paid little or nothing.
According to ILO's most recent global estimate, there are at least 20.9 million victims of forced labor, trafficking and slavery in the world today. About 90 per cent of today's forced labor is exacted in the private economy, primarily in labor intensive industries.
Labor traffickers often make false promises of a high-paying job or exciting education or travel opportunities to lure people into horrendous working conditions. Yet, victims find that the reality of their jobs proves to be far different than promised and must frequently work long hours for little to no pay. Their employers exert such physical or psychological control including physical abuse, debt bondage, confiscation of passports or money that the victim believes they have no other choice but to continue working for that employer.
Forced labor affects millions of men, women and children around the world and is most frequently found in labour intensive and/or under-regulated industries, such as:
</h2>

<ul>
  <h3>
  <li>Agriculture and fishing</li>
  <li>Domestic work</li>
  <li>Construction, mining, quarrying and brick kilns</li>
  <li>Manufacturing, processing and packaging</li>
  <li>Prostitution and sexual exploitation</li>
  <li>Market trading and illegal activities</li>
</h3>
</ul>
<h2>Forced labour is a global problem, although some regions have larger numbers of people affected than others.  The regional distribution of forced labour is:</h2>
<ul>
  <h3>
  <li>Asia and Pacific: 11.7 million (56%)</li>
  <li>Africa: 3.7 million (18%)</li>
  <li>Latin America and the Caribbean: 1.8 million (9%)</li>
  <li>The Developed Economies (US, Canada, Australia, European Union, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Japan): 1.5 million (7%)</li>
