<h1><center>Forced Labor</center></h1>
<p> Men, women, and children in all countries are victims of forced labor. Forced labor is the holding of a person against their will, using a debt, contracts, trafficking,  etc. - sometimes to force them to work off a unrepayable bill. It’s extremely similar to bonded labor (for more bonded labor facts click on it’s tab). Most of the total slave population exists in the Eastern Hemisphere. Governments are aware of this worldwide occurrence. If governments didn’t allow these things to happen, the fashion and fish industry would have withered away as time has passed. The laborers work in terrible conditions and are paid little to nothing. The more they get paid, the bigger their debt becomes, and if one of the slaves get sick and the owner pay for the hospital bill it also adds to the debt as well. The men most likely work in strength-based jobs and most women are put into sex slavery or sweatshops. The slaves are abused physically and psychologically.

There are many people that are forced to do work for no pay and little food. As stated in the article “Combating Human Trafficking”,“Between 600,000 and 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders each year”. This happens not only in the third world but in our own country as well.
