  <h1><center>Forced Labor</h1></center><h3>
  <h2>Men, women, and children in all countries are victims of forced labor. Forced labor is the holding  a person against their will through punishment , sometimes to force them to work off a unrepayable bill. It's extremely similar to bonded labor . Most of the total slave population exists in the Eastern Hemisphere. Governments are aware of this worldwide occurrence. If governments did not allow these things to happen, the fashion and fish industry would have withered away as time has passed. The laborers work in terrible conditions and are paid little to nothing. The more they get paid, the bigger their debt becomes, and if one of the slaves get sick and the owner pays for the hospital bill it also adds to the debt as well. The men most likely work in strength-based jobs and most women are put into sex slavery or sweatshops. The slaves are abused physically and psychologically.
