  Modern day slavery is one of the largest crime organizations in the world, yet so many people do not know about it. People need to understand that this doesn't just happen in developing countries like Saudi Arabia, but also in first world countries like America. The general public needs to know how this happens to people so that something could be done to stop it. From there, we can rebuild the ruined lives of former slaves and reintroduce them into society.

  <div> <h2><u>Bonded Labor</u> </h2> </div>
  <h2>
  Bonded labor is one of the least known types of slavery but itâ€™s possibly one of the largest slavery organizations in the world. Someone becomes a bonded slave when labor is demanded as a way to repay a loan or debt. Bonded labor has existed for hundreds of years. It spreads from everywhere, from Asia to America. Bonded labor exist because of the discrimination and poverty the world faces. And despite slavery being illegal, many governments refuse to enforce the law.

  <div><h2><u> Forced Labor</u> </div></h2>
  <h2>
  Forced labor is when someone is forced to work against their will under some form of punishment. Forced labor affects men, women, and children around the world. Almost all slavery practices such as bonded labor, have some type of forced labor element implemented into it. Forced labor is illegal in international law and in most national legislations around the world.

  <div><h2><u>Sex Trafficking</u></h2></div>

  	<h2>
  Sex trafficking is one of the more known types of slavery as it exists in America and also globally. Sex traffickers use violence, lies, threats, and debt to force adults and children to have commercial sex against their will. How people get into sex trafficking can vary. Some are sold into sex slavery by their parents. Others are lured and tricked into false promises of a good job. It can last from one month to years. Sex slavery is one of the most dominant types of modern slavery in America today.
