<u><h1>How it relates</h1></u>
<h2>
Modern day slavery is very important to us. It is one of the largest crime organizations in the world,
yet so many people do not know about it. People need to understand that this doesn't just happen in poor countries.
This occurs all the time in first world countries like America but also in third world countries,
the general public needs to know how this happens to people so that they can unite as one to stop it.
From there, we can rebuild the ruined lives of former slaves and reintroduce them into society.

<h1>Bonded Labor </h1>
<h2>
Bonded labor is possibly one of the largest slavery organization in the world. But it is also one of the least known types of slavery.
Somebody becomes a bonded slave when labor is demanded as a way to repay a loan or debt. Bonded labor has existed for hundreds of years.
It spreads from everywhere, from Asia to America.Bonded labor exist because of the discrimination and poverty the world faces.
And despite slavery being illegal, many governments refuse to enforce the law.
